# Two's New Starter Guide - Season 3

Are you slightly overwhelmed with all the new features and have no idea where to start? **Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ve got you.**

The game is ever evolving so this document will keep changing as the new seasons land but for Season 3.. if I were you, this is where Iâ€™d start:

## 1) Missions
Missions are hands down the most important thing to get the ball rolling on. The concept of missions is to build and grow your own Empire which will reward you daily for your hard work. 

The mission map looks like this, **the different districts will require you to complete 3 tasks** for your daily Empire Reward. As you can see in the screenshot below, Greenwich requires you to **steal 8 cars, repair 12 rares and buy 62,794 bullets** which in return will reward you with **2 Autorank perks.**

</p>

As you continue to work your way through the map, these Empire Rewards will start to stack up. The more districts you complete, the higher the Empire value will be which you could sell for Points but I'm not sure I'd recommend that at this point as the daily income is so handy. Once you've sold your Empire, you're unable to start again and that will be you done with missions for the current Season!

I've completed 17 Districts in total so far and these are the daily Empire rewards I get currently along with the Point price my Empire is worth.

You're probably thinking, why are these rewards so good? *I'm getting there.*

160 Points a day, 10 Autorank perks.. 2 epic scraps? ðŸ”¥

This takes us nicely onto the second point I've got for you.

## 2) Autorank Perk

There is a very slim chance that you've NEVER played one of these games before, but if you haven't and this is your first time then Hey and welcome ðŸ‘‹
..if not then you'll know that these games can be time consuming right with all the crimes, GTAs, and Heists and everything else which you need to click while trying to fit that in around your actual life!? 

How on earth are you ever going to find the time do everything this game has to offer?

**Autorank Perk says hello.**
*This is why you can see above in the missions, I'm focusing on the ones which give me Autorank perks as the Empire rewards!*

**1 Autorank perk** will play for you for 2 hours doing;
- Commits all Crimes available for you based on your rank
- GTA on timer every time
- and finally, Heists which is a blessing!

Your perks can be found in the **'My Inventory'** page and it'll look something like this:

</p>

Again, they stack from the Empire rewards but 25 of them can be purchased from the Points page for 3000 points or a single one for 125p. I'd save up and buy the 25 myself but if you focus on missions then you shouldn't need to!

The other perks in the screenshot above are 100% worth adding when you get them too. Who doesn't like the sound of juicy double XP or being immune from being sent to Jail?

## 3) Seasons

If you've never played Fortnite or Call of Duty or any other huge title then you've been living under a rock and won't be familiar with a 'battle pass system' which is what Seasons is for International Gangsters. It's basically passive rewards for playing the game. I know, being rewarded for nothing. 

This is where you'll need to make a decision for yourself on how you approach this as there are some different options with the Seasons feature.

</p>

- Players **without VIP** will receive the Tier rewards in the Yellow box up to tier 10.
- Players **with VIP** will receive the level rewards from 1-50 which are shown in the Blue box aswell as the Yellow tier rewards.
- Players **with VIP+** will continue from level 51 all the way through to 100.

Again, you'll need to make your own decision on what is the best option for you but the VIP+ plan will offer you the best value for money with the Point rewards.
Level 47 and Level 50 in the screenshot for example reward you with 15,000 points which is the exact same value as VIP+ if you were to buy them off the Points page alone... no brainer for me but each to their own!

## 4) Basic Ranking Fundamentals

As a strict rule of thumb, you want to be doing everything you can inside the 'Ranking' panel you'll see whether you're on PC or mobile.

- **Crimes** | Stay on top of committing them to rank up and earn money if you don't have Autorank running.
- **Jail** | Busting will give you some small income depending on reward of the bust. They're a bit difficult at the start but have patience with them.
- **GTA** | You'll need to be doing this to complete your missions and it gives XP.
- **Repair** | Gives you a small bit of XP for repairing vehicles. Some missions require you to repair a certain type of vehicle too so keep an eye on that. You can make profit on selling cars too, damage or repaired so it's something to think about.
- **Missions** | Biggest priority for me, above everything else really.
- **Heist** | The best way to rank for XP but it has a 2 hour cool down, 1 hour cool down if you have the perk on, but make sure you do them as much as you can. Also inside missisons so... yeah. Keep an eye on what your requirements are.

## 5) Civilian Protection

When you load into the game, you'll be placed under protection which basically exists to let you get to grips with the game first without being blast into oblivion by a more experienced player. I'd suggest on taking full advantage of this while you're learning about all the new features we offer but there are certain rules which you must play within.

Performing any of the below will make you killable:

You'll find the button at the bottom of the page which will allow you to terminate it without needing to break one of the rules
