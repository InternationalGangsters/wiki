# Game Rules

## Disclaimer
International Gangsters is a new game that is currently developing it's approach to a multitude of elements of the game to ensure a fair, level game experience for all players. This means there may be some minor adjustments or additions to these game rules as we evolve through the seasons and experience new interactions with players and areas of the game. Please give us the time and feedback necessary to make any adjustments we need to as we move forward.


## Duping & Multiple Accounts
Having multiple accounts is not allowed under any circumstances. The use of multiple accounts will result in a modkill & confiscation of wealth.
Account sharing is not tolerated in any shape or form and will result in all involved being banned.

Moving forward the use of family accounts on the same IP address is no longer allowed. This has caused a number of issues that we can't realistically monitor continuously going forward so this is now no longer allowed.

We will however look into instances where players are temporarily on the same IP address or where we are completely satisfied that there are two clear players playing the game 100% of the time. For example we know some of you have family or go to group BBQs (unlucky you cunts, that's just me), and we will review this on a case-by-case basis but you MUST tell us in advance or we will treat accounts on the same IP address as dupes and will modkill one or all of them.

We accept there is no one rule fits all in this situation but blanket closing down this as an option but making you to come to us on a case-by-case basis to allow any IP sharing is the only sensible way forward from now on.

We will not be looking into any retrospective use of family accounts.

Thanks if you have any questions or concerns either use the helpdesk where I can see them all or my private DMs on here.

*This is now a ZERO-TOLERANCE rule break, players will be banned who are found to have made mass accounts.

## Buying/Selling/Transferring Wealth
Any and all instances of buying, selling and/or transferring wealth on other games or for real life money/services is prohibited. We have measures in place that allow us to detect transfers like this and we will modkill and remove wealth from players in any and all instances of this occurring. The only official and acceptable place to get in-game currency (points) is the 'Points' page.

## Personal Information
Any use of personal information on the forum or other forms of communication is prohibited. We will meet malicious use of personal information with a zero tolerance approach and you will be muted or worse.

## Telegram Chat

## VPN/Proxy Rules
We do allow for VPN use, however if you are found to be duping or account sharing either through a VPN or a Proxy you will be placed in court and a moderator will determine the appropriate action. Note- This includes residential IP addresses, we know the difference.

## Bugs & Exploits
You may not use any bug or exploit to benefit in any way, you should report any bugs found to a member of staff immediately with as much detail as possible. If you are found to have benefited from an exploit you will have the wealth gained removed and further punishments may occur.

If you report a bug at first instance you may be given a reward for this - Please use the helpdesk or message a member of Interpol to report bugs.

## Casino Rules
You may hold 1 Casino and 1 Property. If you are holding more than the allowance you will be given 1 hour to either sell the property or send it to someone else. After 1 hour the property will be dropped.

## Gambling
When you use casinos on the game you do so at your own risk and only you are liable for the amounts won and lost. Staff will not reimburse any amount that is lost or won by virtue of the regular mechanics of casinos. Great measures have gone in to ensuring the odds of properties are proportionate to the levels of return for the stake.

This includes, but is not limited to, Dice Game, Roulette, Race Track, Slot Machine, Multidice Games, Blackjacks and/or Sports Betting.

Constant irregular winnings/losses may be subject to investigation from staff to ensure there are no issues.
The use of bots, macros and/or autoclicking or systematic betting programmes are not allowed.

## Terms of Service
These rules run alongside the Terms of Service you agreed with when you registered your account on the site.

## Ban on Sight List:
A 'ban on sight' list means a player has been banned and will be banned whenever we get notice they are playing. Players should report any known BoS player to staff immediately, failure to do so may result in a Modkill.
