This forum has been built specifically to allow users to win cash/points. Staff members known as Entertainers will run games on this forum, there are 3 types of games an entertainer can post.

1. Dice - a multiplayer dice game with a set number of players and a set pot, once the game is full the entertainer will roll the dice and the winner will receive the pot

2. G-Box - a multiplayer dice game with a set number of players and a set pot. Once the spots have been filled the entertainer will roll the dice and each player will receive a % of the pot. There may also be times where a user will receive a bonus prize.

3. Custom - here entertainers can use their imagination and post custom built games with a set pot. An example of this could be "Guess the Flag". Users can comment their answer and once the entertainer sees a correct answer, they simply "Select" the winner and they will receive the pot.
