# Blackjack

Possibly the worlds most recognized Casino game, the game is simple, it's you vs the dealer. Whoever gets closest to (or hits 21) wins! If you go above 21 you bust and lose, if the dealer goes above 21, they bust, and you win. Special feature on this BJ game is the double down button, this will enable you to double your original stake for 1 extra card (only available on your initial 2 cards). Risky but extremely rewarding when it pays off!
