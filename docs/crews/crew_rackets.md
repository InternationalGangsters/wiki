# Crew Rackets

Crew members can produce 3 racket items every hour these are Drugs, Counterfeit Cash and Weapons. Producing these will earn them money from the crew bank.

Prices the crew boss can sell these for a profit change every hour so you need to be quick to maximise your profit. 

Limits on the number of racket produce a crew can hold in storage at one time may force a crew to sell their produce at a less than ideal price to make sure they can continue paying crew members otherwise production will be halted.
