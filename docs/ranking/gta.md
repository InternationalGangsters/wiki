# GTA

This wouldn't be a mafia game without a staple crime, stealing a car. There are over 25 cars available to be stolen, and you can attempt to steal a car every 2 minutes. Be careful though, if you get caught you may end up in prison. There are 4 types of cars that can be stolen.
1. Normal
2. Rare
3. Very Rare
4. Exclusive
All of which have varying melting values, travel times and repair costs. The best vehicles in the game are exclusives. Each exclusive is only available once, so you need to be quick if you want to steal one!
