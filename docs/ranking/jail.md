# Jail

If you fail a crime or other ranking facility, there's a good chance you will end up in jail! You can be sent to jail for various times, and you can only be released if another user chooses to bust you. If you attempt to bust another user you may end up being caught and sentenced yourself, so do so at your own risk, you can also generate NPC Bots which are slightly easier to jail bust to help you with missions.
