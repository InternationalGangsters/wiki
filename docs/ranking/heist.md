# Heist

Heist is a great (but risky) way of gaining alot of money and xp. To set up a heist you will choose options from 3 factors.

First we have the Yellow box, which is the heist you wish to commit. 

Secondly in the Green box, you will choose the crew you wish to hire to execute the heist for you, you will need to pay them up front and the crew you decide will determine the chance of success you have. 

Finally you will need to choose which equipment you wish your crew to use which is highlighted in Blue. Once again you will need to pay for this upfront, the equipment you choose will decide the cool down time for when you can attempt to commit another heist. 

Once you are ready simple click "start job" If you are happy with your selections you then confirm it. Note; there is a chance you can fail this and if you fail you will lose any setup costs. Once you have completed your first heist you then have the option to replay that heist in the future which is highlighted in Red.

Autorank will always attempt to replay your last Heist to make sure you've selected the options you'd like to run before putting the Autorank perks on.
