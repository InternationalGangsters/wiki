# Making Money

Everyone's end goal is to become wealthy so let us try to help you with a few tips of ways to make money.

## 1) Crimes

Seems like the obvious one but the easiest risk free (except Jail but who cares) way of getting money is to do Crimes. The pay outs can be bufed by using the Double Pay perk which you can find in the My Inventory page. You can obtain this with Points or through completing missions.

If you've got Autorank Perks, chuck them on to get the most of out Crimes/GTAs and Heists as you'll be able to earn money this way without playing.

## 2) Missions

Completing the Missions will increase your daily Empire rewards.

The bottom left hand side table in the screenshot above shows how much passive income you can make every day. The more Missions you complete, the higher the daily $$ income can be. The points can be sold using quicktrade too which is another way of passive income.

## 3) Selling Cars

In order to complete your Empire, some of the Missions will require you to repair cars. This has encouraged more people to start selling their cars as users want to complete their Missions faster.

Look at how much the cars are listed for before you sell them to make sure that you're offering a competitive price. I'd also recommend to consider whether you want to repair them or not as either way, someone will want them. Very easy little money maker if you can passively obtain cars through GTA with Autorank running.

## 4) Quicktrade

This one will require a little bit more patience but the idea is to buy lower and sell higher and flip the profits in the middle. Make the most of proposing offers for points using your cash and then offers for cash using your points and continue to flip with the profit difference between the two values.

This one requires patience and a bit of work to keep an eye on the Quicktrade offers as it's a competitive market. People can out price you quite quickly so it's important to remember what price you bought/sold for to make sure that you make a profit.

## 5) Risk vs Reward

The riskier methods! ðŸ‘€

Slots.. $1b max bet with a potential of 100x as a pay out? Definitely worth a punt if you ask me....

The second way I'd suggest but again, risky! Holding property's isn't proven to make you money but if you're able to buy one then give it a shot as making a bit of profit this way!
