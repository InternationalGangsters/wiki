# Scrapyard

Once you have stolen a car you can opt to melt it in exchange for bullets. Each car has its own melting value that is also influenced by the damage it has, these can be changed on the repair page. 

If you are part of a crew you may also receive a melting reward bonus for hitting crew boss determined interval or milestone. Your crew will take a set % of all bullets you melt.
