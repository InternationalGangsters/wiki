# Witness Statements

When a player shoots another player, there is a chance that your account will 'witness' the kill and you'll get a notification to say X (user) shot Y (user/bodyguard).

You'll get notifications of live witness statements inside your normal notifications section:

As you can see above, Eevee has been naughty and has been shooting Lorenzo and Juan... I wonder who's bodyguards they were!

Also, inside the Offence section there will be a Witness Statement page. Here you can see a list of witness statements that you have received, and you can also check the codes provided to validate any WS sent to you. A player might ask for the code to ensure that the statement was valid and that you're not just trying to frame someone else! ðŸ‘€

Sometimes players will reward you for providing them with the code if it's legit, but do you really wanna be a snitch....
