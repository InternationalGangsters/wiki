# Travel by Car

If you have cars, you can use them to travel to different cities/countries.

The highlighted yellow box at the top is a dropdown which will let you pick which car you'd like to use. After that, simply click on the location you'd like to travel too and wait the timer before you arrive!

Each car has it's own travel time and every time you travel (if you use a very rare car or below) it will accrue damage each time you travel. Once the damage hits 100% the car will be dropped.
