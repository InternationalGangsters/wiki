# Battle Arena
Welcome to the Battle Arena, a new feature specifically designed for killing competitions. This page provides information and access to the current competition, as well as the ability to view the current standings.

## Battle Arena Rules & Information
The Battle Arena operates under the following rules:

**Contestant Commitment**: Once entered into the competition, contestants are not allowed to leave until it concludes.

**Points and Bullets**: Each contestant is given a maximum allowance of points and bullets that they can utilize to eliminate other users.

**Prize Winner**: The competition concludes when there is only one contender remaining or the time limit has ran out, and that individual, or the user with most score in case of the timer expiring, will be declared the winner and receive the prize.

**Restricted Interactions**: While participating in the competition, users who are not contestants are prohibited from engaging in actions such as killing, searching, or providing funds to the contestants.
