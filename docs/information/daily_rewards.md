# Daily Rewards

Daily Rewards is a simple higher-lower card game that can be played once a day in the game. The goal of the game is to guess whether the next card drawn will be higher or lower than the previous one. If the player guesses correctly, they have two choices either they can choose to continue for the better rewards or they can cash out and take the current prize, however if you get your pick wrong you will be paid a consolation prize of 1/3 double XP perks. There is also a daily Multiplier for correct guesses so manage your risk accordingly!
