# Daily Rewards

Daily Rewards is a simple higher-lower card game that can be played once a day in the game. The goal of the game is to guess whether the next card drawn will be higher or lower than the previous one. If the player guesses correctly, they can continue playing and earn better rewards. If the player guesses incorrectly, the game ends, and they receive the reward for the last successful guess.

## Rewards
The rewards for Daily Rewards vary based on how far the player gets in the game. The further the player gets, the better the rewards become.
