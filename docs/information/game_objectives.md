# Game Objectives

The Game Objectives feature provides players with regular and automated objectives that they can complete to earn rewards. These objectives can include daily, weekly, and seasonal tasks, as well as weekly challenges that are based on a particular task.

## Daily Objectives
Daily objectives are released every day at 8:20am. These objectives can be completed once per day and provide rewards to the player upon completion. There are no restrictions on the types of objectives that are included in the daily tasks. The rewards for completing objectives are random and not based on the level of difficulty.

## Weekly Objectives
Weekly objectives are released every Friday at 8:30pm. These objectives can be completed once per week and provide rewards to the player upon completion. There are no restrictions on the types of objectives that are included in the weekly tasks. The rewards for completing objectives are random and not based on the level of difficulty.

## Seasonal Objectives
Seasonal objectives are released periodically and include three levels for each category. For example, there may be three levels of crime-related objectives that players can complete to earn rewards. There are no restrictions on the types of objectives that are included in the seasonal tasks. The rewards for completing objectives are random and not based on the level of difficulty.
