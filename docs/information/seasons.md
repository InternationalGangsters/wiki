# Seasons

Seasons is a new ranking system that has been introduced to the game. Each season lasts for three months, during which players earn season XP alongside their normal game XP. The goal is to earn as much season XP as possible by completing various tasks and objectives.

At the end of the season, all season XP progress is reset, and a new season begins. Players who earned a high amount of season XP during the season are eligible for rewards, which vary based on their season rank.

## Rewards
Players who complete the season will receive rewards for each season rank they achieve. Additionally, players can earn rewards by completing tasks during the season. The rewards for completing tasks vary based on the task difficulty.

## Performance
Player performance during the season is measured by the amount of season XP they earn. The more season XP a player earns, the higher their rank will be at the end of the season.

Season XP:
You gain Season XP just by playing the game organically, you can also receive season xp via crates + occasional entertainment forum games hosted by an admin.
