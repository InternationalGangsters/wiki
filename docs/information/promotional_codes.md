# Promotional Codes
The Promotional Codes feature allows administrators to send out codes to players, which can be redeemed for in-game rewards such as cash, bullets, or loot boxes.


Administrators can generate and send out promotional codes to players. These codes can be redeemed by players for various in-game rewards. The rewards offered for each code may vary and can be decided by the administrators.


The Promotional Codes feature can be useful for administrators who want to provide players with additional rewards or incentives for playing the game. It can also be used to promote special events or other activities within the game.

For players, the Promotional Codes feature provides an opportunity to earn additional rewards or bonuses for playing the game. By redeeming promotional codes, players can receive cash, bullets, or other valuable in-game items.

These are rare but usually released during special events + hitting certain milestones such as hitting x number of players online or around Christmas time etc.
