# Dice Game

A simple concept, you choose the amount you wish to bet, how many sides of the dice you want, and your prediction of what number the dice will roll on. If you guess correctly, you will receive a reward relevant to the number of sides you choose. The more sides you choose, the higher the profit potential, and the higher the risk of losing. You can choose between 2 sides and 1000 sides.
