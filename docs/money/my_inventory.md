Common, Rare, Epic Scraps - These are collectable items that are earned or given to you for various things. Once you have 10 of a particular scrap, you can convert them into a crate of the corresponding type. (i.e if you have 10 common scraps, you can convert them into 1 common crate.)
You can also convert your crates into the next tier â€“ IE 10 common crates > 3 rares and 10 rares > 2 Epic crates.
