# Video Poker

Video Poker is a popular casino game that combines elements of traditional poker with the convenience of a slot machine. Players are dealt a virtual hand of cards and can choose to hold or discard any of them. The objective is to achieve the best possible poker hand, such as a pair, three of a kind, or a royal flush. The player's hand is compared to a pay table, and winnings are awarded based on the strength of the hand. Video Poker involves strategy in deciding which cards to hold and discard, making it an engaging and skill-based game.
